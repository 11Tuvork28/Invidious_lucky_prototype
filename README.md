# Invidious prototype with the Lucky framework

Since the invidious project might wanna switch to a diffrent framework I wanna build prototype with the lucky framework just to give some insights.
This repo is using this [template](https://github.com/stephendolan/lucky_jumpstart/) the readme can be found [here](https://github.com/11Tuvork28/Invidious_lucky_prototype/blob/main/README_TEMPLATE.md)
The invidious readme can be found [here](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/blob/master/README.md) and the original code can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/)

# What to expect

Since I work alone on this project and I don't have so much time for it, it won't be fast in development let alone keep up with the original project.
But this isn't the goal of this project because this projects only goal is to give insights on how it could be done with lucky instead of other frameworks.
Maybe it can give the original project a jumpstart when they decide to use lucky.

# Things that work
Basic pages sort of work now
  - feed/popular (No content but navbar etc works)
  - feed_menu shows popular/trending
  - signin can display the login form but auth doenst work atm
